            Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations
            like debugging, task running, and version control. 
            It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves 
            more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.

            The console.log() method writes a message to the console.
            The console is useful for testing purposes.
